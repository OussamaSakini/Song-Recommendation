# Spotify Music Recommendation System

This repository contains a project aimed at building a music recommendation system using Spotify's song dataset. The project explores data mining techniques and machine learning to suggest songs based on user preferences or song characteristics.

## Project Goals
1. Analyze Spotify's dataset to uncover patterns and trends in music.
2. Build a recommendation system that suggests songs based on:
   - Similar song features (e.g., tempo, key, danceability).
   - User listening history or preferences.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset of Spotify songs, which includes attributes such as:
- **Danceability**
- **Energy**
- **Loudness**
- **Speechiness**
- **Acousticness**
- **Tempo**
- **Valence**

## Tools and Technologies
- **Jupyter Notebook** for data analysis and visualization.
- **Python** for implementing the recommendation algorithms.
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Implementation of recommendation algorithms such as:
  - Content-based filtering.
  - Collaborative filtering.
- Visualizations of song trends and recommendations.
